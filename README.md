# CognoRise-INFOTECH

Welcome to the CognoRise Infotech Machine Learning Internship. As part of this internship, I have worked on several tasks that demonstrate my understanding and application of various machine learning algorithms. Below is a summary of the first four tasks I have completed:

## Task 1: Breast Cancer Classification
- Algorithms Used: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression
- Description: Developed a model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using features extracted from mammograms.
- Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data
- Objective: To achieve a high accuracy in predicting the nature of breast cancer tumors based on the dataset provided.
## Task 2: House Price Prediction
- Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Description: Built a model to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and location.
- Dataset: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
- Objective: To accurately predict the house prices using regression models based on the given features.
## Task 3: Spam Email Detection
- Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Description: Created a model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content.
- Dataset: Spam Email Dataset
- Objective: To develop a model that can effectively filter out spam emails and ensure the accuracy of email classification.
## Task 4: Diabetes Prediction
- Algorithms Used: Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost Classifier, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier
- Description: Developed a model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on features such as glucose levels and BMI.
- Dataset: Diabetes Prediction Dataset
- Objective: To accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on the medical features provided.
